### The following solutions are part of Poatek's Software Engineering Internship Program recruitment process.

All the solutions were programmed in an environment with Python 3.9.6. No external libraries were used.

Challenges 1 and 2 were relatively straight forward, so there is only one file and one class. To run it, just open the files contained in the respective directories in an IDE and run it.

Challenge 3 was a bit more complex, so I decided to make two classes in two different files. 
The "fuel_pump.py" file contains the FuelPump class, its attributes and functions.
The "main.py" file contains an example of usage of such class by showing the validations and the operations. To run it, just open the "challange3" directory and run the "main.py" file using your favorite IDE.
